# External GKE Storage

GKE comes with default storage options, and this guide is currently setup to utilize those. However, should an external file system be desired for GKE storage, the Filestore Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver could be used.

For further information on how to set this up, please refer to [this GCP documentation page](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/persistent-volumes/filestore-csi-driver).
